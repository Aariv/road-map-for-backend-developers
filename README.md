# Roadmap 2019 for backend developers

Today's Web development is completely different from a few years ago, and there are many different things that can easily shut people out. This is one of the reasons I decided to make this step-by-step guide and let anyone know clearly what they are doing. The role played in web development.

A detailed road map can be found in the picture below, and I will explain each step in the description below.

Before we started, although we didn't list HTML/CSS knowledge in the roadmap below, we recommend that you at least understand some basic HTML/CSS knowledge.

<b>Step 1 - Learn a Language</b></br></br>
There are many choices about language, and I have divided them into categories to make it easier to make decisions. For beginners who are just getting started with backend development, I suggest you choose any scripting language because they have a lot of features that will get you started quickly. If you have some front-end knowledge, you may find Node.js easier (and a big job market).

If you are already developing the backend and knowing some scripting languages, I recommend not choosing another scripting language, but choosing from "Functional" or "Multiparadigm". For example, if you are already using PHP or Node.js, don't use Python or Ruby, but try Erlang or Golang. It will definitely help you extend your thinking and bring your thoughts to a new horizon.

<b>Step 2 - Practice what you have learned (Practice what you have Learnt)</b></br>
<p>There is no better way to learn than practice. Once you've chosen a language and have a basic understanding of these concepts, you can use them and make as many small apps as you can. Here are some Ideas that let you get started:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Implement some commands you use yourself in bash, such as trying to implement ls;</li>
<li>A write access and save on reddit /r/programmingcommand of the article, and save it as JSON;</li>
<li>Write a command that lists the directory structure in JSON format, such as jsonify dir-name returns a JSON file with the internal structure of dir-name;</li>
<li>Write a command that reads the JSON obtained from the above steps and creates a directory structure;</li>
<li>Consider some of the tasks you will do every day and try to automate them.</li>
</ul>

<b>Step 3 - Learn Package Manager</b></br>
<p>After learning the basics of the language and creating some sample applications, you need to know how to use the package manager for that language. The package manager helps you use external libraries in your application and distribute your own libraries for others to use.</p>

<p>If you choose PHP, you will learn Composer, Node.js has NPM or Yarn, Python has Pip, Java has Maven/Gradle and Ruby has RubyGems. No matter what you choose, keep learning how to use its package manager.</p>

<b>Step 4 - Standards and Best Practices</b></br>
<p>Each language has its own standards and development best practices. For example, PHP has PHP-FIG and PSR. There are many different community-driven guides for using Node.js, and other languages ​​have the same guidance.</p>

<b>Step 5 - Security</b></br>
<p>Be sure to read about security best practices, read the OWASP guide and learn about different security issues and how to avoid them in the language of your choice.</p>

<b>Step 6 - Practice (Practice)</b></br>
<p>You have mastered the basics of languages, standards, and best practices, security, and how to use the package manager. Start creating a package and distribute it for others to use, and be sure to follow the standards and best practices you have learned so far. For example, if you choose PHP, you can post it on Packagist, if you choose Node.js, you can post it on Npm, If you choose Java, you can post it on maven and so on.
</p>
<p>If it's done, search for some projects on Github and mention some PR in some projects. Here are some Ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Refactoring and implementing the best practices learned</li>
<li>View unresolved issues and try to resolve</li>
<li>Add any additional features</li>
</ul>
<b>Step 7 - Learn about Testing</b></br>
<p>Learn how to write unit tests and integration tests in your application, and learn about different test terms such as mocks, stubsetc.</p>
