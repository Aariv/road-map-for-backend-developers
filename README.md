# Roadmap 2019 for backend developers

Today's Web development is completely different from a few years ago, and there are many different things that can easily shut people out. This is one of the reasons I decided to make this step-by-step guide and let anyone know clearly what they are doing. The role played in web development.

A detailed road map can be found in the picture below, and I will explain each step in the description below.

Before we started, although we didn't list HTML/CSS knowledge in the roadmap below, we recommend that you at least understand some basic HTML/CSS knowledge.

<b>Step 1 - Learn a Language</b></br></br>
There are many choices about language, and I have divided them into categories to make it easier to make decisions. For beginners who are just getting started with backend development, I suggest you choose any scripting language because they have a lot of features that will get you started quickly. If you have some front-end knowledge, you may find Node.js easier (and a big job market).

If you are already developing the backend and knowing some scripting languages, I recommend not choosing another scripting language, but choosing from "Functional" or "Multiparadigm". For example, if you are already using PHP or Node.js, don't use Python or Ruby, but try Erlang or Golang. It will definitely help you extend your thinking and bring your thoughts to a new horizon.

<b>Step 2 - Practice what you have learned (Practice what you have Learnt)</b></br>
<p>There is no better way to learn than practice. Once you've chosen a language and have a basic understanding of these concepts, you can use them and make as many small apps as you can. Here are some Ideas that let you get started:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Implement some commands you use yourself in bash, such as trying to implement ls;</li>
<li>A write access and save on reddit /r/programmingcommand of the article, and save it as JSON;</li>
<li>Write a command that lists the directory structure in JSON format, such as jsonify dir-name returns a JSON file with the internal structure of dir-name;</li>
<li>Write a command that reads the JSON obtained from the above steps and creates a directory structure;</li>
<li>Consider some of the tasks you will do every day and try to automate them.</li>
</ul>
